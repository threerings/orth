/**
 * Room parameters in screen coordinates, and associated conversion routines.
 *
 * Rooms are measured in three coordinate spaces: world coordinates, room coordinates,
 * and screen coordinates.
 *
 * In room space, the room is an axis-aligned unit cube, with one corner at the origin and
 * the other at [1, 1, 1]. The player's camera is centered on the [0.5, 0.5, z] axis,
 * and the viewport is defined as the square [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0]] (i.e. the 'front wall'
 * of the unit cube), with origin in the lower left. Objects locations are expressed
 * in room space.
 *
 * World space is intermediate between room and screen; in a standard room, all room positions
 * are the same as world positions. However, horizon value can skew the room by shifting the back
 * wall up or down. This modifies how room x and y values map to world position.
 *
 * In pixel space, the room has a specific height, width, and depth, with origin at upper left.
 * Because the front wall serves as the viewport, and the view is always axis-aligned
 * and looking in the +z direction, conversion into pixel space reduces to projecting
 * all objects onto the front wall, and then converting their x, y coordinates from room space
 * to pixel space.
