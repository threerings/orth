# Orth

Orth is a collection of code for building multiplayer online virtual environments, built atop
[Narya] and [Vilya], mostly extracted from [Whirled] so that we could use it on smaller standalone
projects.

We used it for a game called [Bite Me!] and probably some other stuff that I've forgotten in the
numerous years that have elapsed since those halcyon days.

## Building

Don't even try. I'm sure it has myriad obsolete and long since evaporated dependencies, some
potentially internal to [Three Rings] (RIP). The code is released here mostly for posterity and the
morbidly curious.

If you're really crazy enough to try, you'll need [Ant] and then you can just start debugging the
build failures as they arise. If you have serious questions, file issues, but requests morally
equivalent to "Halp? I have not the clues." will be summarily closed.
