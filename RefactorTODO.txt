 - WorldDirector.as and WorldService.as and friends should be Vault services
 - PlayerObject is what I used in the Vault. I should certainly not use it here in Room/World!
 - DecorGeometry can probably be abandoned and rolled into the new Decor
 - Note that ControlBar references WorldContext even though it's in orth.client; the reason is
   that in theory, this bar would be appropriate both for Social rooms and Intervention rooms.
   We'll see what happens with that. Perhaps more importantly, both ControlBar and WorldControlBar
   should be at the Who level, with abstracted access to/from the client at the Orth layer.
