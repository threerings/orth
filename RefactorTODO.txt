 - WorldDirector.as and WorldService.as and friends should be Vault services

 - PlayerObject is what I used in the Vault. I should certainly not use it here in Room/World!

 - DecorGeometry can probably be abandoned and rolled into the new Decor

 - Note that ControlBar references WorldContext even though it's in orth.client; the reason is
   that in theory, this bar would be appropriate both for Social rooms and Intervention rooms.
   We'll see what happens with that. Perhaps more importantly, both ControlBar and WorldControlBar
   should be at the Who level, with abstracted access to/from the client at the Orth layer.

 - The Party system as imported from MSOY could form the basis of the Doctor one. Unlike a lot of
   the MSOY systems, this one was nicely architected both on the server and on the client. It
   currently relies on Groups, but this dependency can be eliminated (since we don't have groups
   or anything like them on Doctor, possibly with the exception of guilds). For parties to be of
   use to us, of course, they will have to play nice not just with the social rooms but with the
   intervention engine as well.
